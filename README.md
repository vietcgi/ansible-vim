Ansible role: vim
=================

[![MIT licensed][mit-badge]][mit-link]
[![Galaxy Role][role-badge]][galaxy-link]

Ansible role which installs, configures and customizes vim editor.

The role does the following:
 - Removes vim-tiny
 - Installs vim-nox (needed for Powerline plugin)
 - Sets EDITOR environment variable to use vim-nox
 - Installs [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) plugin manager for vim
 - Installs git (as a dependency for Vundle installation)
 - Installs set of Plugins defined in default/main.yml
 - Configures vim (system-wide or per-user) as defined in default/main.yml (using my custom configuration)
 - Installs [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized#important-note-for-terminal-users) and
   customized [Mustang](https://hcalves.deviantart.com/art/Mustang-Vim-Colorscheme-98974484) colorschemes.

IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA to install [Emoji](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-emoji) plugin both system-wide and per user.
Vim sources both system-wide and user's vimrc files and complains about duplicated emoji command.
This will also cause command 'vim +PluginInstall +qall' to hang or fail.

If installing current role system-wide and per user, comment 'junegunn/vim-emoji' in default/main.yaml for system
installation and uncomment it for per-user installation.

### Use case #1: install for shared usage

  You want to install a custom vim settings and plugins in your remote server. This config is shared between all server
  users, but customized settings for a single user is allowed if you want.

  Set `vim_env` variable to `system` in your playbook.

  The common config is placed in `/etc/vim/vimrc.local` (for settings) and `/etc/vim/vimrc.bundles` (for plugins).

  If you need to overwrite any setting or install new plugins for a selected user, you need to put your settings in
  these files: `~/.vimrc.local` and `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`

  **Important**: by default, plugins are installed for `root` user. In all other users you have to install plugins
  manually with command `vim +PluginInstall`.

  Refer to [Vundle documentation](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for plugin management.


### Use case #2: install for a single user

  You want to use this ansible role to provision your own laptop and just want a customized vim for your user. All your
  config lives in your `$HOME` path, just like regular vim install.

  Set `vim_env` variable to `user` in your playbook and set `vim_users` variable with a list of users to install vim.

  The common config is placed in `~/vimrc` (for settings) and `~/vimrc.bundles` (for plugins).

  If you need to overwrite any setting or install new plugins for a selected user, you need to put your settings in
  these files: `~/.vimrc.local` and `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`

  Refer to [Vundle documentation](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for plugin management.
